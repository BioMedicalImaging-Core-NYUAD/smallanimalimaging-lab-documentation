SkyScan 1276 - Main applications
================================

The main application of the SkyScan 1276 is non-invasive in vivo micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging for
**visualizing anatomical structures** in small animal models with high spatial resolution. Its ability to capture detailed
**3D images of bone and soft tissue**, combined with fast scanning speeds and low radiation doses, makes it especially
powerful for longitudinal studies of disease progression, treatment response, and physiological changes over time in live animals.

Here are common applications of in vivo microCT imaging:

- Bone morphometry
    - Analysis of bone microarchitecture and bone mineral density (BMD)
    - Studies of osteoporosis, bone healing, growth, and regeneration
- Lung imaging
    - Functional respiratory analysis using respiratory gating (4D microCT)
    - Monitoring pulmonary disease progression (fibrosis, emphysema, tumor, tuberculosis)
- Body composition analysis
    - Quantification of adipose tissue
    - Quantification of muscular tissue
- Biomaterial implant evaluation
    - Assessment of biocompatibility, structural integrity, and stability of implants
