SkyScan 1276 applications
*************************
The main application of the SkyScan 1276 is non-invasive in vivo micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging for
**visualizing anatomical structures** in small animal models with high spatial resolution. Its ability to capture detailed
**3D images of bone and soft tissue**, combined with fast scanning speeds and low radiation doses, makes it especially
powerful for longitudinal studies of disease progression, treatment response, and physiological changes over time in live animals.
