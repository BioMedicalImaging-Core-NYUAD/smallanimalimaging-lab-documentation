Small Animal Imaging Core
#########################

The Small Animal Imaging Core, in collaboration with the NeuroWaves Lab and the Brain Imaging Lab, forms the Biomedical
Imaging Coreâ€”one of twelve specialized facilities within the Core Technology Platforms (CTP) at NYU Abu Dhabi.
CTP encompasses a wide range of advanced instrumentation, supported by a team of dedicated scientists and technical
experts who manage equipment maintenance, provide comprehensive user training, and facilitate research operations across
the university.
For more information about available technologies and support services, please visit the CTP website:

Maylis Boitet, DVM, PhD
=======================

Small animal imaging research scientist
---------------------------------------
Since August 2023, Dr. Boitet has served as the inaugural Research Instrumentation Scientist for the Small Animal Imaging
Core at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD). She earned her Ph.D. from Institut Pasteur Korea, where she characterized
a reporter mouse model for neuroinflammation using in vivo optical imaging. Her research focuses on neuroscience and optical
imaging, with particular emphasis on the application of advanced imaging modalities to study brain function in preclinical
models. Dr. Boitet also holds a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree from VetAgro Sup in Lyon. At NYUAD, she actively
collaborates with researchers to integrate non-invasive imaging strategies into preclinical research studies.
