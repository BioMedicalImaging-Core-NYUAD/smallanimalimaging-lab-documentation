Small Animal Imaging Core
=========================

The **Small Animal Imaging Lab**, in collaboration with the **NeuroWaves Lab** and the **Brain Imaging Lab**, forms the Biomedical
Imaging Core, one of twelve specialized facilities within the **Core Technology Platforms** (CTP) at NYU Abu Dhabi.

Since August 2023, Dr. Boitet has served as the inaugural **Research Instrumentation Scientist** for the Small Animal Imaging
Lab at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD). She earned her Ph.D. from Institut Pasteur Korea, where she characterized
a reporter mouse model for neuroinflammation using in vivo optical imaging. Her research focuses on **neuroscience** and optical
imaging, with particular emphasis on the application of **advanced imaging modalities** to study brain function in preclinical
models. Dr. Boitet also holds a **Doctor of Veterinary Medicine** (DVM) degree from VetAgro Sup in Lyon. At NYUAD, she actively
collaborates with researchers to integrate **non-invasive imaging strategies** into preclinical research studies.

Location
--------
The Small Animal Imaging Core is located within the **AAALAC-accredited vivarium** in Basement Level 2 of the Experimental
Research Building, C1 at New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE.
