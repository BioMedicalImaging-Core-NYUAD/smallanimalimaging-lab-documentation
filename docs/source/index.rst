############################################

The Small Animal Imaging Core, together with the NeuroWaves Lab and the Brain Imaging Lab, constitutes the Biomedical
Imaging Core, one of the twelve specialized cores that form the Core Technology Platforms (CTP) at NYUAD.
CTP comprises a broad array of cutting-edge instrumentation managed by dedicated scientists and technical specialists,
who oversee equipment maintenance, provide user training, and support research operations across the university.

Maylis Boitet, DVM, PhD
=======================
Since August 2023, Dr. Boitet has led the Small Animal Imaging Core at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) as its
inaugural Research Instrumentation Scientist. She earned her Ph.D. from Institut Pasteur Korea, where she developed
a reporter mouse model of neuroinflammation using in vivo optical imaging. Her research focuses on neuroscience and
optical imaging, particularly the use of advanced imaging techniques to study brain function in preclinical models.

Additionally, she holds a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree from VetAgro Sup (Lyon, France), where she studied
the naturally occurring L120Q mutation in the rVKORC1 protein in wild rats, linked to resistance to antivitamin K
compounds.


Location
********
The Small Animal Imaging Core is located within the AAALAC-accredited vivarium in Basement Level 2 of the Experimental
Research Building, C1 at New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE.


Contact
