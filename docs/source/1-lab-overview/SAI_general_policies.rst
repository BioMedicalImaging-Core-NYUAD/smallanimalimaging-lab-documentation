SAI General Policies
====================

Compliance
----------
Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable NYUAD policies, including those set by the **Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee** (IACUC), the **Institutional Biosafety Committee** (IBC), the **Controlled Substance Program,** and the
**Radiation Safety Program**. Prior to conducting any imaging procedures, users must provide the core staff with a copy of their
approved IACUC protocol, and if applicable, an approved Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) protocol.

Failure to comply with SAI policies, rules, and procedures may result in temporary suspension of booking privileges.

Anesthesia
----------
Each imaging station within the core is equipped with an isoflurane anesthesia system. Imaging sessions are conducted
with animals anesthetized using isoflurane, unless an alternative method is specifically requested and scientifically
justified. Users are required to supply their own isoflurane bottles for imaging sessions and must adhere to NYUAD
guidelines governing the use of Controlled Substances. Training on the operation of the anesthesia system is included
as part of the mandatory imaging user training. Activated charcoal canisters must be weighed prior to the use of the anesthesia system.
Following each session, users must turn off the oxygen supply valve and anesthesia vaporizer, and flush the system to ensure safe and proper maintenance.

SAI facility hygiene guidelines
-------------------------------

Surface and equipment decontamination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users are responsible for maintaining **cleanliness and organization** within the Small Animal Imaging Laboratory. All work
areas, the anesthesia induction chamber, and any equipment or accessories that come into contact with animals must be
cleaned and disinfected after imaging procedures. Direct spraying of disinfectant inside imaging equipment is strictly
prohibited; instead, all surfaces should be gently wiped using a tissue saturated with MB-10 solution. The only exception
is the imaging stage of the IVIS Spectrum, which must be cleaned using 70% ethanol.

Post-use equipment standby
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Users are responsible for ensuring that all equipment is returned to its original **standby mode** after use. This includes
recapping cameras when applicable, closing imaging chambers or lids, properly shutting down acquisition software, securing
system components, and returning all accessories to their designated storage locations. These steps help maintain equipment integrity,
prolong system lifespan, and ensure readiness for the next user.

Material storage and sample containment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To maintain a clean and controlled environment, users must minimize the number of items brought into the Small Animal
Imaging facility. Live animal cages must remain closed and be sprayed with MB-10 solution before being returned to the vivarium.
External samples must be sealed in appropriate containers and disinfected with MB-10 solution prior to exiting the room.
All materials belonging to research teams must be stored in the designated transparent containers located inside the cupboard,
clearly labeled with the teamâ€™s name. No items should be left on laboratory benches, imaging stations, or computer desks
at any time.

Animal transfer to husbandry room
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The SAI room is considered a "dirty" area relative to the rest of the vivarium.
To prevent cross-contamination, the following decontamination procedures must be followed:

- Before returning animal cages to the vivarium husbandry room using a trolley, spray each cage thoroughly with MB-10 disinfectant solution.
- When entering the vivarium corridor from the SAI room, either spray your gloves with MB-10 solution or replace them with a fresh pair. Additionally, wear an extra pair of shoe covers.

SAI resource management
-----------------------

Scheduling
^^^^^^^^^^
The Small Animal Imaging (SAI) facility uses the **CTP booking system** for centralized scheduling and management of imaging
resources. All core users are required to utilize this system to reserve equipment prior to accessing services. To schedule
an experiment in the SAI lab, visit https://corelabs.abudhabi.nyu.edu/, navigate to the Reservations section, select Schedule,
and from the upper drop-down menu choose Brain Imaging, then book the appropriate resource.
For additional details, please refer to the "Scheduling Policies" section.

Data storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Research data is available in the **shared SAI folder**, organized by individual researcher names. For access permissions,
please contact maylis.boitet@nyu.edu.
Access to subfolders is restricted based on user credentials. Users are encouraged to reorganize their data in accordance
with their specific study to facilitate efficient data retrieval. All users are strongly encouraged to maintain their own backups.

Data processing workstation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A dedicated **CTP processing workstation** is available for users to conduct data analysis. Users can directly access their data from the
shared SAI folder on this common workstation.
For remote access or to book the workstation, please contact maylis.boitet@nyu.edu.
When using the shared workstation, users are advised not to save their data on the local hard drive, as files may be altered
or deleted by other users. Instead, users are encouraged to store their data on secure platforms such as their NYU Box,
Google Drive, or their private SAI shared subfolder.
