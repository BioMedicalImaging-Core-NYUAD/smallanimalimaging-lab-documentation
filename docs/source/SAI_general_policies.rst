The oxygen supply valve and anesthesia vaporizer must be turned off and the anesthesia system must be flushed after used.


SAI Facility Hygiene Guidelines
*******************************

Surface and equipment decontamination
=====================================
Users are responsible for maintaining cleanliness and organization within the Small Animal Imaging Laboratory. All work
areas, the anesthesia induction chamber, and any equipment or accessories that come into contact with animals must be
cleaned and disinfected after imaging procedures. Direct spraying of disinfectant inside imaging equipment is strictly
prohibited; instead, all surfaces should be gently wiped using a tissue saturated with MB-10 solution. The only exception
is the imaging stage of the IVIS Spectrum, which must be cleaned using 70% ethanol.

Post-use equipment standby
==========================
Users are responsible for ensuring that all equipment is returned to its original sleep or standby mode after use. This
includes recapping cameras when applicable, closing imaging chambers or lids, properly shutting down or securing system
components, and returning all accessories to their designated locations.  These steps help maintain equipment integrity,
prolong system lifespan, and ensure readiness for the next user.

Material storage and sample containment
=======================================
To maintain a clean and controlled environment, users must minimize the number of items brought into the Small Animal
Imaging room. Live animal cages must remain closed and be sprayed with MB-10 solution before being returned to the vivarium.
External samples must be sealed in appropriate containers and disinfected with MB-10 solution prior to exiting the room.
All materials belonging to research teams must be stored in the designated transparent containers located inside the cupboard,
clearly labeled with the teamâ€™s name. No items should be left on laboratory benches, imaging stations, or computer desks
at any time.


SAI Resource Management
***********************

Scheduling
==========
The Small Animal Imaging (SAI) facility uses the CTP booking system for centralized scheduling and management of imaging
resources. All core users are required to utilize this system to reserve equipment prior to accessing services. To schedule
an experiment in the SAI lab, visit https://corelabs.abudhabi.nyu.edu/, navigate to the Reservations section, select Schedule,
and from the upper drop-down menu choose Biomedical Imaging, then book the appropriate resource.

Cancellation
============
Users must cancel any scheduled imaging sessions as early as possible to allow reallocation of resources. Cancellations
should be made at least 24 hours in advance through the CTP booking system. Repeated last-minute cancellations or no-shows
may result in temporary suspension of booking privileges. Please notify core staff immediately in the event of unavoidable
delays or emergencies.
