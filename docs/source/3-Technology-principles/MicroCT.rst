In vivo microCT
===============

Technology overview
-------------------
In vivo micro-computed tomography (microCT) is a powerful, non-invasive, non-destructive and high-resolution imaging modality
that allows for the **visualization and quantification of anatomical structures and physiological changes** in live animal models.
It operates by acquiring a **series of X-ray projections from multiple angles**. 2D projections are secondly reconstructed
into slice-by-slice cross-sectional images to provide a detailed 3D volumetric datasets of internal features with micrometer-scale precision.

This technology is particularly advantageous in preclinical biomedical research due to its ability to provide quantitative
structural information from live rodents such as mice and ratsâ€”without the need for surgical intervention or destructive sampling.
By enabling longitudinal studies, microCT allows researchers to follow anatomical changes over time in the same animal.
MicroCT excels in imaging high-density tissues such as bone, teeth, and implants, and can be extended to soft tissues using
contrast agents. Compared to optical imaging, microCT provides superior anatomical detail and penetration depth, though it
requires careful management of radiation dose for repeated in vivo applications.
