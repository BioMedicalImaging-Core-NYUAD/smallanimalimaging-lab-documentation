SAI Lab Description
===================

The Small Animal Imaging Laboratory (SAI) at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) is a cutting-edge research facility
dedicated to advancing biomedical investigations. Situated within an AAALAC-accredited vivarium (Basement Level 2,
Experimental Research Building, C1), the laboratory offers a comprehensive range of in vivo and ex vivo imaging modalities,
encompassing anatomical, structural, functional, and molecular imaging capabilities. These advanced technologies are readily
accessible to NYUAD researchers, facilitating high-resolution, non-invasive studies in preclinical models.

Imaging Equipment
*****************
The core facility houses the following advanced imaging systems:

- Optical Imaging System – IVIS Spectrum (Revvity)
- Micro-Computed Tomography (microCT) – SkyScan 1276 (Bruker)
- Customized Rodent Endoscope – Karl Storz
- Miniscope and Behavioral Imaging Platform – nVue and nVision (Inscopix)

Applications

Research Support and Services
*****************************
In addition to imaging services, the facility offers expert consultation, specialized training in the operation of imaging
equipment, and support for data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Furthermore, it provides researchers with secure
data storage and access to high-performance computing resources. These comprehensive capabilities support the design
and implementation of longitudinal studies investigating disease progression, therapeutic efficacy, and molecular
mechanisms in murine models (mice and rats).

Contact

***************
All publications (manuscripts, abstracts, presentations, posters, and also in their grant applications) based on work
conducted in the SAI Core should acknowledge NYUAD Core Technology Platforms.
A suggested statement is as follows:
"This research was partially carried out using the Core Technology Platforms resources at New York University Abu Dhabi."
In addition, if CTP Scientists/Specialists provide significant experimental design, data interpretation, or other
intellectual contribution as evaluated by the PI, then it is appreciated if these individuals are considered as coauthors
on the publications.
