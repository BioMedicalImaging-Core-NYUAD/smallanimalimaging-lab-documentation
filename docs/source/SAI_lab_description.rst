SAI Lab Description
===================

The Small Animal Imaging Lab (SAI) at NYUAD is a state-of-the-art facility supporting advanced biomedical research. Housed within an AAALAC-accredited vivarium (basement 2 of the Experimental Research Building, C1), the lab offers comprehensive, non-invasive in vivo imaging servicesâ€”including optical imaging, microCT, endoscopy, and miniscope imaging. It also provides expert consultation, equipment training, data acquisition, and image analysis to facilitate the design and execution of longitudinal studies that examine detailed aspects of animal anatomy, physiology, metabolism, and gene expression in mice and rats.
