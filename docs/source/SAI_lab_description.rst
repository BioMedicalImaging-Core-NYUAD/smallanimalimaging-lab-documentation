SAI Lab Overview
===================

Established in 2023, the Small Animal Imaging Laboratory (SAI) at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD) is a state-of-the-art research facility
dedicated to advancing biomedical research through small animal imaging. Located within an AAALAC-accredited vivarium, the
laboratory provides a comprehensive suite of in vivo and ex vivo imaging modalities, encompassing anatomical, structural,
functional, and molecular imaging techniques. These advanced imaging capabilities enable high-resolution, non-invasive
investigations in preclinical models and are readily available to researchers at NYUAD.

SAI, together with the NeuroWaves Lab and the Brain Imaging Lab, constitutes the Biomedical Imaging Core, one of the twelve
specialized cores that form the Core Technology Platforms at NYUAD. This platform comprises a broad array of cutting-edge
instrumentation managed by dedicated scientists and technical specialists, who oversee equipment maintenance, provide user
training, and support research operations across the university.

Imaging Equipment
*****************
The core facility houses the following advanced imaging systems:

- Optical Imaging System – IVIS Spectrum (Revvity)
- Micro-Computed Tomography (microCT) – SkyScan 1276 (Bruker)
- Customized Rodent Endoscope – Karl Storz
- Miniscope and Behavioral Imaging Platform – nVue and nVision (Inscopix)

Applications

Research Support and Services
*****************************
In addition to imaging services, the facility offers expert consultation, specialized training in the operation of imaging
equipment, and support for data acquisition, processing, and analysis. Furthermore, it provides researchers with secure
data storage and access to high-performance computing resources. These comprehensive capabilities support the design
and implementation of longitudinal studies investigating disease progression, therapeutic efficacy, and molecular
mechanisms in murine models (mice and rats).

Core staff
**********
Maylis Boitet, DVM, PhD

Since August 2023, Dr. Boitet has served as the inaugural Research Instrumentation Scientist leading the Small Animal
Imaging Core at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD). Prior to joining NYUAD, she earned her Ph.D. from Institut Pasteur Korea,
where she developed and characterized a novel reporter mouse model of neuroinflammation, utilizing in vivo optical imaging
techniques. Dr. Boitet’s research interests are centered on neuroscience and optical imaging, with a particular focus on
the development and application of advanced imaging methodologies to investigate brain function and pathology in preclinical
models.
Before pursuing her Ph.D., Dr. Boitet received her Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree in 2016 from VetAgro Sup
(National Veterinary School of Lyon, France). During her veterinary studies, she worked on the characterization of the
naturally occurring L120Q mutation in the rVKORC1 protein in wild rats, a mutation associated with resistance to antivitamin
K compounds.
Since joining NYUAD, she has actively collaborated with multiple investigators to incorporate non-invasive imaging modalities
into a wide range of preclinical research projects.

Booking
*******
The SAI facility employs the CTP booking system for the centralized scheduling and management of imaging resources.
All core users are required to utilize this system to reserve equipment and access services.

Location
********
The Small Animal Imaging Core is located within the AAALAC-accredited vivarium in Basement Level 2 of the Experimental
Research Building, C1 at New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE.

All publications (manuscripts, abstracts, presentations, posters, and also in their grant applications) based on work
conducted in the SAI Core should acknowledge NYUAD Core Technology Platforms.
A suggested statement is as follows:
"This research was partially carried out using the Core Technology Platforms resources at New York University Abu Dhabi."

In addition, if CTP Scientists/Specialists provide significant experimental design, data interpretation, or other
intellectual contribution as evaluated by the PI, then it is appreciated if these individuals are considered as coauthors
on the publications.
